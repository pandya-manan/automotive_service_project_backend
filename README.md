## 📡 Service Registry – Eureka Server  

📝 **Eureka Server** acts as a **service registry**, enabling **service discovery** in a microservice architecture.  
It allows services to **register themselves** and **discover other services** dynamically, eliminating the need for hardcoded host/port configurations.
