Automotive Service Center Project


Eureka Server is a service registry that enables service discovery in microservice architectures.
It allows services to register themselves and discover other services dynamically, eliminating the need for hardcoded host/port configurations.

Microservices
1. Sign Up Service: Developed using spring boot for signing up users new to the automotive service center portal.
2. Login Service: Developed using spring boot for allowing valid users to login to the automotive service center portal. Concepts such as spring security and jwt based token have been used.
